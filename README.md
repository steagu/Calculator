# .NET GUI Calculator

Using C# and .NET, this project creates a simple GUI calculator. 

I doubt anyone will really find a use for this code, including myself, because far superior solutions for 
	calculators exist for free preinstalled on most computers. This project was mainly an exercise for practice.


Disclaimer:
This project was inspired by and is very similar to a class assignment. Permission is granted for this code to be used for all
	purposes EXCEPT cheating on a school assignment. DO NOT use this project to cheat.
