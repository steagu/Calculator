#.NET Calculator

Here I used .NET to implement a GUI Calculator for Windows. This calculator is very basic, and I would never actually use
	it to be honest. I made it more than anything as an exersize to practice using .NET. Obviously, it is redundant to
	build, since Windows already comes with a much better GUI Calculator. Feel free to look around at it. 

I used Microsoft Visual Studios to complete this project.
